## üìã Overview

This project builds upon [Kepano's](https://bsky.app/profile/stephango.com) work on the Obsidian Webclipper. I've explored his approach to managing an [Obsidian Vault](https://stephango.com/vault) and adapted it to fit my BASB (Building a Second Brain) informed process. I mainly wanted to create one template to cover all the articles I will come in contact with so I can just 'one click' them no matter the website. It still needs work on tightening up the LMM prompts in general though I have found it helpful thus far.

The key enhancements include integration with:
- [Obsidian Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/properties)
- [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin

## ü§ñ LLM Integration

These templates rely on using [Interpreter](https://help.obsidian.md/web-clipper/interpreter) for an LLM to:
1. Ingest webpage content
2. Generate structured outputs for different sections of the template

I currently use **Gemini 2** via Google's [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) with their API, which is cost-effective for these low-volume needs.

## üéØ Purpose

As a Psychotherapist and Relational Meditation Researcher, I created these templates to streamline my research process when gathering information from various sources:
- Academic journals
- News articles
- Research papers
- And more

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## üß© How It Works

The templates use specific prompt structures enclosed in double curly braces:

&nbsp;

```
{{ "prompt text that the LLM processes and responds to" }}
```

&nbsp;

### Example Prompt

The most complex prompt is used for the "Genre" property field:

&nbsp;

```
{{ "Analyze this article and classify it as exactly ONE of these types (respond with ONLY the type name):

Research: Academic journal articles, scientific studies, scholarly papers, conference proceedings, data-driven analysis with methodology, papers with citations and references

News: Factual reporting of current events, journalistic coverage, breaking news, investigative reporting, objective accounts of recent happenings

Opinion: Editorials, commentary, perspective pieces, viewpoints, subjective analysis, articles expressing personal judgment or stance on issues

Reviews: Critical evaluations of products/services/media, literature reviews, critiques, assessments that judge quality or performance

Informational: Educational content, tutorials, how-to guides, explainers, reference materials, articles that primarily aim to teach or inform without bias

If the article combines multiple types, select the PREDOMINANT category based on primary purpose and structure." | wikilink }}
```

&nbsp;

### Real-World Example

When testing with my personal website ([maxmilne.com article](https://maxmilne.com/index.php/2025/02/04/discovering-interbe-ing-a-personal-and-professional-journey/)), the Genre generated is: `[[meditation]]`.

This is a simple example of how this template works.
